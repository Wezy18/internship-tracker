# Internship Tracker

A simple, user-friendly **React application** for tracking internship and job applications in one place. This app allows users to add applications, update their status, filter by progress, and keep track of next steps through a clean, intuitive interface.

The project was built to strengthen my understanding of **modern React fundamentals** while emphasizing thoughtful UX, clear state management, and maintainable component design.

## Features
- View a centralized list of internship and job applications
- Filter applications by status (Interested, Applying, Submitted, etc.)
- Add new applications using a controlled form
- Reusable application card components
- Clean, responsive layout with a soft, accessible design
- Status badges for quick visual feedback

## Tech Stack
- React (functional components & hooks)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vite (development tooling)

## What I Learned
- Breaking a user interface into reusable, composable React components
- Managing application state using `useState`
- Filtering and rendering dynamic data with `.map()` and `useMemo`
- Handling user input with controlled form components
- Structuring styles for clarity and long-term maintainability
- Improving usability through layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy

This project reinforced how small frontend decisions - such as component structure, state flow, and naming - can significantly impact both user experience and code readability.

## Getting Started
To run the project locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Then open your browser at:

```arduino
http://localhost:5173
```
## Future Improvements
- Persist application data using localStorage
- Add edit and delete functionality for applications
- Introduce deadlines with calendar support
- Improve accessibility and keyboard navigation
- Add basic component and interaction tests

## Why This Project
As a student actively applying for internships, I wanted to build a tool that reflects a real-world use case while strengthening my frontend skills. This project demonstrates my ability to design, build, and iterate on a complete React application with a focus on usability, structure, and practical problem-solving.

I built this project to simulate a real-world frontend workflow: managing state, handling user interactions, and presenting data in a clear, user-centered way. It reflects my interest in frontend development and my focus on building clean, intuitive interfaces while continuing to grow my React skills.
