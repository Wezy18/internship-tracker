Internship Tracker

A simple, user-friendly React application for tracking internship and job applications in one place. Users can add applications, update their status, filter by progress, and keep track of next steps - all through a clean, intuitive interface. This project was built to practice modern React fundamentals while focusing on thoughtful UX and maintainable component design.

Features

- View a list of internship applications
- Filter applications by status (Interested, Applying, Submitted, etc.)
- Add new applications through a controlled form
- Reusable application card components
- Clean, responsive layout with a soft, accessible design
- Status badges for quick visual feedback

Tech Stack

- React (functional components & hooks)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vite (development tooling)

What I Learned

- How to break a UI into reusable React components
- Managing application state with useState
- Filtering and rendering dynamic data using .map() and useMemo
- Handling user input with controlled form components
- Structuring styles for clarity and maintainability
- Improving UX through layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy

This project helped reinforce how small frontend decisions - like component structure and state flow - directly affect usability and code readability.

Getting Started

To run the project locally: npm install npm run dev

Then open your browser to: http://localhost:5173


Future Improvements

- Persist application data using localStorage
- Edit and delete existing applications
- Add deadlines with calendar support
- Improve accessibility and keyboard navigation
- Add basic component tests

Why This Project

I built this project to simulate a real-world frontend workflow: managing state, handling user interactions, and presenting data in a clear, user-centered way. It reflects my interest in frontend development and my focus on building clean, intuitive interfaces while continuing to grow my React skills.
